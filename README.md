# Overview

I'm becoming more comfortable with SQL and wanted to integrate with some simple software. 

To do this I wrote a simple menue system in python that creates a database that can be added to, edited, or queried from.

SQLite3 takes a string and runs it as SQL.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

This is a simple table that stores contact information.

# Development Environment

leveraged sqlite3 in Python

# Useful Websites

* [join() function | Geeks for Geeks ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/join-function-python/)
* [SQLite Intro](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-update/)

# Future Work

* fix address in 5)
* add more query functionaly
* create more relational tables
* connecct it to a [GUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)
